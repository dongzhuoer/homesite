<p>In the last section of <em>Bioinformatics Challenges, at the Interface of Biology and Computer Science, Mind The Gap</em>, the author recommands Utopia Documents, so I decide to install it (otherwise it should be quite hard to follow the book).</p>
<p>According the official guide, I add neurodebian’s repository to <code>apt</code>, but <code>utopia-documents</code> can’t be found.</p>
<p>Windows installer is fairly easy, so I consider to swicth to Windows to experience this software.</p>
<p>Then I search Google, from an answer for early version of Ubuntu, I try to install <code>neurodebian</code>. During the installation, a pop up asks me whether to add extra repository, and I choose “yes”. Thus the method seems same as above, and unsurprisingly failes.</p>
<p>Later, I search for <code>.deb</code> and find one. Looking at the long dependency list, I foresee the installation would fail. And it indeed, <code>libpoppler68</code> is missing <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I find a <code>.deb</code>; then <code>python-imaging</code> is missing, and I find another <code>.deb</code>. It won’t suprise me if a third package is missing, conversely, the installation succeed this time.</p>
<p>I can’t wait and try the software. Several minutes later, I get amazed by its functionality. All the effort pays.</p>
