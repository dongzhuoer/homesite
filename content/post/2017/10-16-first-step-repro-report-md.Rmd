> I can't haste `.docx` more. 

When I conducted internship in Gao's lab, I have managed to produce weekly report using markdown. Storing my work in plain text made me feel very good.

Basically I only need to full-width the figure and center figure caption, after convert `.md` to `.docx` via `pandoc`. 

A remained annoyance thing is table, `pandoc` not only can't produce a pretty one, but also leaves a very ugly one which is hard to remove. 

Maybe I should use R Markdown latter since it's important to put source code in the markdown file.
