<script src="/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script>


<p>当时在鼓捣 bookdown，尤其是 build others’ book。</p>
<p>突然发现 RStudio Viewer panel 无法正常显示 book。</p>
<p>调试一番之后，发现是由于 link to a CSS file out of the output directory.</p>
<p>So I use Rscript <code>website/bookdown/bookname</code> to add CSS file.</p>
<p>Update: on 11/07, I give up it, maybe I will report the bug someday. Anyway, I decide to stick to <code>/bookdown.css</code>, because you can see the effect immediately after modifying the CSS file without building again.</p>
<p>Update on 12/07: I saw that RStudio’s View panel only works for local resources. That might explain this issue.</p>
