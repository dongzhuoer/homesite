> 我的 GitHub user name 变来变去，从 `dongzhuoer` 到 `gitzhuoer`，再回到 `dongzhuoer` ^[该死的是有人已经抢占了 `zhuoer`，还一个 repo 都不建，给我多好啊]；连带着 homesite 的 url 也不稳定。下面是我以前写的一篇 post：

## fix GitHub user name

I decide not to change my GitHub use name anymore, at least `dongzhuoer.github.io` would be stable. Even I grab `zhuoer` luckily ^[the original user cancel the account and I 抢到 it], I would create a link. 

Even now, I would see some repository still set remote url to `gitzhuoer`.

## make netlify stable

Actually I tend to make `dongzhuoer.github.io` stable, but it suddenly doesn't work. Anyhow, make `dongzhuoer.netlify.com` stable shall not be too much extra overload. After all, Netlify's service is quiet good.
