<p>I can’t haste <code>.docx</code> more.</p>

<p>When I conducted internship in Gao’s lab, I have managed to produce weekly report using markdown. Storing my work in plain text made me feel very good.</p>
<p>Basically I only need to full-width the figure and center figure caption, after convert <code>.md</code> to <code>.docx</code> via <code>pandoc</code>.</p>
<p>A remained annoyance thing is table, <code>pandoc</code> not only can’t produce a pretty one, but also leaves a very ugly one which is hard to remove.</p>
<p>Maybe I should use R Markdown latter since it’s important to put source code in the markdown file.</p>
