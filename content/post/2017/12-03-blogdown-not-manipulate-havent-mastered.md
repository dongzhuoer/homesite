Another afternoon is wasted. Maybe I just can't help myself because I can get fun from fiddling with programming.

This time I try to customize **blogdown**:

- First I want `blogdown::serve_site()` to use the same port I configured **apache**. However, it doesn't work. 
- Next I want it to use Chrome rather than RStudido Viewer panel. But then it would open RStudio's homepage. 
- Finally I try to prevent this and failed in the end.

Gradually, I get into wasting more time than what it promises to save. To make things worse, many times it doesn't work so I can't save any time. In fact, the `Show in new windows` in RStudido Viewer panel is already handy enough.

In conclusion, just _accommodate to_ what you feel uncomfortable with, unless you are quiet familiar with it and _able_ to change something.
