<p>Another afternoon is wasted. Maybe I just can’t help myself because I can get fun from fiddling with programming.</p>
<p>This time I try to customize <strong>blogdown</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First I want <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> to use the same port I configured <strong>apache</strong>. However, it doesn’t work.</li>
<li>Next I want it to use Chrome rather than RStudido Viewer panel. But then it would open RStudio’s homepage.</li>
<li>Finally I try to prevent this and failed in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gradually, I get into wasting more time than what it promises to save <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In fact, the <code>Show in new windows</code> in RStudido Viewer panel is already handy enough.</p>
<p>In conclusion, just <em>accommodate to</em> what you feel uncomfortable with, unless you are quiet familiar with it and <em>able</em> to change something.</p>
