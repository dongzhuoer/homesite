<p>How can my paper stay alive, rather than dead on day of publishing? Here <strong>alive</strong> means others spend little effort while enjoy substantial benefit in using it.</p>
<div id="readme" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> readme</h1>
<p>We assume user would read <code>readme.md</code> before using the software (I prefer “Installation” title).</p>
<p>I won’t explain everything, for example, user is supposed to know <code>install.packages("blogdown")</code> should be executed in R terminal. Luckily, the second result when you Google <code>install.packages</code> leads to a detailed tutorial with screenshots.</p>
</div>
<div id="automatic" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> automatic</h1>
<p>Another way is to automatically install dependencies when user run the software. Actually I haven’t come out a fair solution yet.</p>
<p>Convenient as it seems, someone heats changing their runtime environment.</p>
<p>Currently, I assume user would run my workflow step by step, so I just put the installation code on the top. The code is configured to <em>only</em> run in CI environment such as Travis (<code>CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=true</code>), as I don’t want to waste time on my computer (<code>install_github()</code> still runs even if the packages is already installed).</p>
