<p>My bookdown site on Netlify collapsed. I immediately know CSS is ruined then waste several minutes investigate the problem.</p>
<p>When I was about to get despaired, I suddenly found the local website works well. According to that, I found the problem results from an optimization option:</p>
<pre><code>CSS
  |---- Bundle CSS: Concatenate consecutive CSS files together to reduce HTTP requests.</code></pre>
<p>To conclude, don’t set <code>Bundle CSS</code> on Netlify, at least for <code>index.html</code> of bookdown site (I use a relative link for css there).</p>
