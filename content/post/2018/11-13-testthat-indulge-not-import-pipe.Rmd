```{r install-pkg, message=FALSE, eval=Sys.getenv('CI') == 'true'}
# install needed R packages
remotes::update_packages(c('testthat'), upgrade = TRUE)
```


**magrittr** is a wonderful package, but the biggest drawback is that you can't write `magrittr::%>%`.

That can cause _great_ pain in package development, I spend a whole morning to debug.

Basically, I summary the following rules:

- **testthat** ignores `.Rprofile`
- In theory, every pipe operator used _must_ be imported from magrittr
- except for `%>%` (testthat import and export it)


```{r comment=''}
testthat::`%>%`
```
